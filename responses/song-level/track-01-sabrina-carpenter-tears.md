### 🎭 Sarcasm as Social Commentary

The sarcastic framing — treating mundane chores like **doing dishes** or **assembling IKEA furniture** as if they’re grand, romantic gestures — reveals Sabrina’s frustration with how **basic acts of responsibility** are disproportionately celebrated when performed by men. This isn’t just humor for humor’s sake; it’s commentary on:

- The **emotional labor imbalance** many women face  
- How rare it is to find a partner who takes initiative without being asked

### 💡 Idealization vs. Reality

By calling communication her *“ideal foreplay,”* she flips traditional gender expectations. Instead of physical intimacy being the ultimate connection, she’s expressing that what she truly craves is **thoughtfulness**, **effort**, and **mental presence** — qualities often overlooked or undervalued.

This suggests her views on men are not inherently cynical, but **disappointed** — she desires mutuality and maturity, yet feels conditioned to accept scraps and smile.
