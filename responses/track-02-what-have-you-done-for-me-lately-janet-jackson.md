## 💬 ChatGPT Response: "What Have You Done for Me Lately?" by Janet Jackson

Janet Jackson’s *“What Have You Done for Me Lately?”* is a direct critique of how emotional labor and attentiveness often decline once men feel secure in a relationship. Through a blend of storytelling and rhythmic repetition, Janet implies that initial effort is often performative — and once the relationship feels "won," that energy dissipates.

### 🔄 From Pursuit to Passivity

> *“Used to be a time when you would pamper me / Used to brag about it all the time”*

These lines contrast past attentiveness with present neglect, underscoring a common relational pattern: men often invest heavily in the early, courtship phase, but struggle to sustain emotional or romantic effort once the relationship becomes stable or routine.

Jackson suggests that male effort is conditional — activated by the need to impress, not by genuine or ongoing care. Once the external reward (e.g., partnership status, social validation) is secured, the internal motivation seems to vanish.

### 👀 Image vs. Reality

> *“Your friends seem to think that you're so peachy-keen / But my friends say neglect is on your mind”*

Here, she highlights the discrepancy between public perception and private reality. The male partner maintains a socially appealing persona, but the emotional labor required to maintain intimacy at home is ignored. Janet uses the chorus — *“What have you done for me lately?”* — as a rhythmic demand for accountability, asking: Are you still showing up in meaningful, active ways?

### 🛋️ Symbolic Domestic Stagnation

> *“Now it seems your dancin' feet are always on my couch”*

This image is rich with metaphor. The man, once energetic and engaging, is now literally immobile — physically present but emotionally disengaged. The couch becomes a symbol of stasis, of checking out, of comfort prioritized over connection.

> *“Good thing I cook or else we’d starve to death”*

This line further emphasizes the unseen labor women are expected to carry — caregiving, emotional nourishment, and responsibility for sustaining daily life, often without thanks or reciprocity.

### 🎯 Implied Message About Gender Roles

Janet Jackson implies that once many men feel secure in a relationship, they withdraw effort — often unconsciously — relying on their partner’s continued emotional and practical labor to hold the relationship together. In contrast, women are often expected to maintain the rhythm, intimacy, and energy, even as they go unacknowledged.

The song becomes a demand for equity — not just in material gestures, but in emotional consistency. It's not about grand romance; it’s about the sustained act of showing up.
