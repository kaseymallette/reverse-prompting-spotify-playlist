# 🎵 Prompt Engineering Meets Storytelling through Music

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project uses **ChatGPT 4o** to analyze a custom **Spotify playlist** as a storytelling mechanism for exploring:
- Gender roles
- Relational power dynamics
- Romantic idealization and disillusionment

Instead of using ChatGPT to *generate* the story, I reverse the process — treating the AI as a mirror to reflect back a narrative I’ve already constructed through song choices.

> 🌀 *Reverse Prompt Engineering*: I’ve trained ChatGPT on how I think, and now I want to see whether it can reconstruct the story I’ve embedded in the playlist — without me explicitly telling it.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Use **alternating male and female artists** to create two narrative voices.
- Explore how *expectations of love* are shaped by **gendered beliefs**.
- Trace the emotional arc from **idealization**, to **emotional entanglement**, to **disillusionment**.
- Analyze whether ChatGPT can surface and reflect the intended themes through conversation.

## 🧩 Narrative Structure (Playlist as Story Arc)

1. **Part 1 – Fantasy & Projection**  
   - The characters haven’t met yet. 
   - Each song reveals their internal desires and imagined ideals.  
   - Commentary on societal gender roles, relationships, and the search for validation.

2. **Part 2 – Collision Course**  
   - They meet and enter a relationship neither is emotionally equipped for.  
   - Tension brews as the illusion of the “ideal partner” begins to unravel.

3. **Part 3 – Disillusionment & Rejection**  
   - The relationship ends with emotional whiplash.  
   - She feels betrayed by his emotional withholding. He feels judged and unseen.  
   - It’s not heartbreak. It's contempt masked as indifference, and resentment masked as pride.

4. **Part 4 – Recognition & Reflection**  
   - He spirals in the aftermath. He's hurting, but too proud or ashamed to express it.  
   - She senses his pain but doesn’t fully understand it. It’s confusing and disorienting.

## 🧪 Methodology

- Prompts were crafted to evoke interpretation of:
  - Lyrics and tone
  - Emotional dynamics
  - Character psychology

- ChatGPT’s responses are treated as "readings" of the playlist narrative.

- My role: curator of both the *songs* and the *questions*.  
  ChatGPT’s role: decoder, analyst, unintentional co-author.

## 🔁 Why This is Prompt Engineering

- **Iterative Prompting**: Prompts were adjusted for tone, specificity, and insight depth.
- **Persona Alignment**: I trained ChatGPT over months on how I think, what I value, and how I analyze art.
- **Model as Collaborator**: I use ChatGPT not to *generate* story, but to *validate* and *illuminate* mine.
